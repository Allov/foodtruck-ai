## In Progress
- Battle encounter system
  - Core phases working
  - Basic scoring system implemented
  - Score feedback implemented
  - Need to complete card combination system
  - Need to implement synergy system
- Card effect implementation
  - Basic structure in place
  - Need full effect system
- UI systems

   - Implement card combinations
   - Add synergy calculations
   - Add battle-type specific mechanics
2. Implement remaining encounter types
   - Complete negative encounters
   - Expand beneficial encounters
   - Flesh out lore system
3. Add progression systems
   - Chef experience system
   - Unlock mechanics
   - Achievement tracking
4. Polish and feedback
   - Add sound system
   - Improve visual feedback
   - Add particle effects
5. Content creation
   - More card varieties
   - Additional encounter types
   - Extended story elements

## Known Issues
1. Market balance needs tuning
2. Card effects need implementation
3. Save system needs expansion
4. Sound feedback missing
5. Game state persistence between encounters needs improvement
6. Chef progression system incomplete
7. Content variety limited
8. Performance optimization needed for larger maps
