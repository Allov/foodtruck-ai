   - Market encounter variety
   - Reward structure implementation

2. Market System
   - Bargaining mechanics
   - Seasonal variations
   - Special orders
   - Loyalty system
   - Inventory management

3. Game State & Persistence
   - Save/load system expansion
   - Progress tracking
   - Achievement system
   - Statistics tracking

4. Polish & Feedback
   - Sound system implementation
   - Visual feedback improvements
   - UI polish
   - Status message enhancements

## On Hold
- Battle encounter refinements
- Card combination system
- Synergy calculations
- Battle-type specific mechanics

## Known Issues
1. Market balance needs tuning
2. Card effects need implementation
3. Save system needs expansion
4. Sound feedback missing
5. Game state persistence between encounters needs improvement
6. Chef progression system incomplete
7. Content variety limited
8. Performance optimization needed for larger maps
