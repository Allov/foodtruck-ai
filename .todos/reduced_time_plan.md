# Reduced Time Development Plan

## Time Constraints
- Limited development time for next few weeks
- Need to maximize impact of short sessions
- Focus on critical path only

## Priority Tasks (15-30 min sessions)

### Week 1: State Persistence
- Day 1: Save game state structure
- Day 2: Basic save/load for map progress
- Day 3: Chef/deck persistence
- Day 4: Test and debug saves
- Day 5: Verify state consistency

### Week 2: Core Loop Connection
- Day 1: Link map to encounters
- Day 2: Connect encounter results to progression
- Day 3: Basic win/loss conditions
- Day 4: Progress tracking
- Day 5: Victory/defeat screens

### Week 3: Essential Polish
- Day 1: Critical feedback messages
- Day 2: Basic sound cues
- Day 3: Minimal tutorial hints
- Day 4: Essential UI fixes
- Day 5: Final testing

## Development Guidelines
1. Commit early and often
2. Focus on one small task per session
3. Maintain debug flags for testing
4. Skip non-essential features
5. Keep documentation current

## Skip For Now
- CRT shader optimizations
- Advanced market features
- Complex progression systems
- Non-essential encounters
- Detailed tutorials
- Achievement system
- Sound variety
- Visual polish

## Quick Session Checklist
1. Review last session's work
2. Pick ONE small task
3. Test changes
4. Commit
5. Update todo list

## Emergency MVP Scope
If time becomes even more limited, focus only on:
1. Map → Battle → Progress loop
2. Basic save/load
3. Win/loss conditions
