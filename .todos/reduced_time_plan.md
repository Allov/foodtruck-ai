# Reduced Time Development Plan

## Time Constraints
- Limited development time for next few weeks
- Need to maximize impact of short sessions
- Focus on critical path only

## Priority Tasks (15-30 min sessions)

### Week 1: Complete Core Loop Connections
- Day 1: Connect existing battle results to progression
- Day 2: Implement proper reward distribution
- Day 3: Link market purchases to deck updates
- Day 4: Add proper win/loss state tracking
- Day 5: Test full gameplay cycle

### Week 2: Game State Persistence
- Day 1: Design save data structure
- Day 2: Implement progress saving
- Day 3: Add deck/inventory persistence
- Day 4: Create autosave system
- Day 5: Test save/load functionality

### Week 3: Essential Polish
- Day 1: Add missing feedback messages
- Day 2: Implement basic sound cues
- Day 3: Create minimal tutorial hints
- Day 4: Polish UI transitions
- Day 5: Final testing

## Development Guidelines
1. Commit early and often
2. Focus on one small task per session
3. Maintain debug flags for testing
4. Skip non-essential features
5. Keep documentation current

## Skip For Now
- Additional battle types (already have Food Critic)
- Complex market features
- CRT shader optimizations
- Advanced progression systems

## Quick Session Checklist
1. Review last session's work
2. Pick ONE small task
3. Test changes
4. Commit
5. Update todo list

## Emergency MVP Scope
If time becomes even more limited, focus only on:
1. Map → Battle → Progress loop
2. Basic save/load
3. Win/loss conditions
