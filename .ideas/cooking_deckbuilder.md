# Cooking Deck Builder Roguelike

## Core Concept
A roguelike deck-building game where you play as a chef battling through procedurally generated "kitchen dungeons", collecting ingredients, recipes, and cooking techniques as cards.

## Gameplay Elements

### Cards Types
1. Ingredient Cards
   - Basic: vegetables, meats, spices
   - Rare: exotic ingredients, special seasonings
   - Legendary: mythical ingredients (dragon fruit, phoenix eggs)

2. Technique Cards
   - Knife skills (Slice, Dice, Julienne)
   - Cooking methods (Sauté, Grill, Braise)
   - Special techniques (Flambé, Molecular Gastronomy)

3. Recipe Cards
   - Act as powerful combinations/combos
   - Unlock special effects when specific ingredients are combined
   - Grant bonuses for future runs

### Roguelike Elements
- Each run is a "shift" in different themed restaurants
- Different "biomes" are cuisine types (Italian kitchen, Asian fusion, etc.)
- Boss battles are cooking competitions against master chefs
- Permadeath means failing your restaurant shift

### Progression System
- Unlock new ingredients through exploration
- Learn techniques from defeated chef bosses
- Discover secret recipes in hidden areas
- Upgrade kitchen equipment between runs

### Combat/Challenge System
- "Combat" is actually timed cooking challenges
- Enemies are food critics, health inspectors, or rival chefs
- Health system based on kitchen reputation
- Time management as a critical resource

## Unique Mechanics

- Balance temperature for perfect cooking
- Overheating causes food to burn
- Too low heat results in raw food

- Create fusion dishes for bonus effects

### Kitchen Hazards

- Kitchen equipment malfunctions
- Rush hour scenarios
- Special order challenges

## Visual Style
